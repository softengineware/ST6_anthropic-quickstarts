## üìÇ Original Description

Anthropic Quickstarts is a collection of projects designed to help developers quickly get started with building applications using the Anthropic API. Each quickstart provides a foundation that you can easily build upon and customize for your specific needs.

## Getting Started

To use these quickstarts, you'll need an Anthropic API key. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for free at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).

## Available Quickstarts

### Customer Support Agent

A customer support agent powered by Claude. This project demonstrates how to leverage Claude's natural language understanding and generation capabilities to create an AI-assisted customer support system with access to a knowledge base.
